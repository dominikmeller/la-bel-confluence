# Confluence Decision Sync - Usage Guide

## Installation

```bash
pip install atlassian-python-api
```

## Environment Setup

Set these environment variables:

```bash
export CONFLUENCE_URL='https://your-domain.atlassian.net'
export CONFLUENCE_USERNAME='your-email@company.com'
export CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN='your-api-token'
```

### Getting Your API Token

1. Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Enter a label (e.g., "Decision Sync Script")
4. Copy the generated token

## Usage

### Basic Synchronization
```bash
python confluence_decision_sync_enhanced.py 123456789 sample_decisions.md
```

### Command Line Options
- `--no-preserve`: Remove decisions that exist only in Confluence
- `--dry-run`: Show what would change without making changes (not implemented yet)

## Markdown Format

Each decision should follow this format:

```markdown
## Decision Title
[[Owner Name]]

Decision description with details...

**Status**: Approved|In Progress|Planning|Research Phase
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Formatting Support
- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- *Italic text* with `*text*`  
- `Code snippets` with backticks
- Lists with `-` or `*`
- Multiple paragraphs

## How Sync Works

1. **Parse Markdown**: Extract decisions from ## headings
2. **Extract Confluence**: Get existing decisions from target page
3. **Compare**: Match decisions by title, compare content hashes
4. **Sync Changes**: 
   - Add new decisions from markdown
   - Update changed decisions  
   - Preserve unchanged decisions
   - Keep Confluence-only decisions (unless --no-preserve)

## Sync Results

The script provides detailed output:
- ‚ú® Added: New decisions from markdown
- üìù Updated: Changed decisions  
- ‚û°Ô∏è Unchanged: Decisions with no changes
- üîó Final page URL

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive decision titles** - They're used for matching
2. **Always specify owners** with [[Name]] syntax
3. **Keep markdown file in version control** for change tracking
4. **Run sync regularly** to keep Confluence updated
5. **Test with a copy page first** before syncing important pages

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify CONFLUENCE_URL (should include https://)
- Check username is your full email address
- Ensure API token is valid and has Confluence access

### Sync Issues  
- Ensure page ID exists and you have edit permissions
- Check markdown syntax (## headings, [[Owner]] format)
- Verify special characters in decision titles

### Permission Errors
- User must have page edit permissions
- Space admin rights may be required for some operations
